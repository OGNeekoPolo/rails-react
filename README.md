## Rails React Practice

Welcome to my rails-react practice app. I recently graduated from the Iron Yard's 12 Week program in Indianapolis, IN, where I specialized in Ruby on Rails. Although the program may be finished, the learning is not. Therefore, I will be attempting to teach myself React.

Skills:

-  Ruby
-  Rails
-  Bootstrap
-  React
-  Webpack
-  PostgreSQL
